# Sample data

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
```

# Points
```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "p", main = "Points",cex=2)
```
# Lines
```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "l", main = "Lines",lwd=2)
```
# Both points and lines

```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "b", main = "Both points and lines",lwd=2,cex=2)
```

# Both points and lines (overlapping points and lines)
```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "o", main = "Overlapping points and lines",lwd=2,cex=2)
```
# Histogram-like vertical lines
```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "h", main ="Histogram-like vertical lines",cex=5)

# Stair steps
```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "s", main = "Stair steps",cex=2)
```
# Other stair steps (starts from the top left corner)
```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "S", main = "Other stair steps",cex=2)
```
# No plotting
```{r}
plot(x, y, type = "n", main = "No plotting")
```
